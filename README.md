What Airbnb is? 
Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. It allows property owners to list their place as holiday accommodation or for lodging and allows travelers to find a place to stay while they are away from home. 

Primary Goal: The main objective of this exploratory data analysis project is to understand the Airbnb customer's priority and selection criteria for choosing a room type present in a particular neighborhood group of New York City and analyze the behavior of the hosts.

Solution:

Analyzing and Exploring the Dataset
Importing libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium (geospatial visualization)
Data Wrangling: removal, replacement, and fixing the invalid data, missing values, and outliers (extreme values)
Data Visualization: With the help of libraries like matplotlib and seaborn we plot graphs from the data (cleaned) given.
Observing and Taking out Conclusions from the graphs and plots.

Conclusions:
Understanding about the three different room types, all the five neighbours, customer preference, performance of hosts & many more which will help the company in taking futuristic decision.
